    `
      I started web programming by using JavaScript. Most of my early static web projects were written 
      in JavaScript. Now I prefer to use TypeScript whenever possible.
    `

  "typescript":   [
    `
      TypeScript is my go-to language in web development. This portfolio was written in TypeScript, 
      while using React. It being statically typed and helping ensure code is functional are some 
      of the reasons why I prefer it over JavaScript.

  "html":         [
    `
      Obviously, I have a strong understanding of HTML. It works well when I want to create very basic
      web pages.

  "java":         [
    `
      I used Java when learning about the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm. These days I 
      primarily use it for back-end development.

  "python":       [
    `
      The very first programming language I have used. It was my main language for early projects.
      On top of that, I used it to finish my first project I have taken seriously: FollowTracker.
      I am confident with my skills with Python and have seen its value in things like web-scraping,
      basic application creation and general-purpose programming.

      In terms of work, I have created both client and server scripts for a university course. The 
      students used the client script I had written in order to access the server in a Raspberry Pi.
      The intention was making Wireshark captures.
