      I started web programming by using JavaScript. Most of my early static web projects were written 
      in JavaScript. I still may use vanilla JS for creating simple websites that do not have a lot of 
      complexity. Now I prefer to use TypeScript whenever possible, especially for larger projects.

    `
      TypeScript is my go-to language in web development. This portfolio was written in TypeScript, 
      while using React. It being statically typed and helping ensure code is functional are some 
      of the reasons why I prefer it over JavaScript.
    `
  ],

  "react (ts & js)":        [
    `
      React is the most important library I use for front-end development. It has come very handy when
      I have built complex web applications like LangMaster. Building components effectively means I 
      can separate large things into blocks that I can then either combine or work on separately.

  "html":         [
    `
      Obviously, I have a strong understanding of HTML. It works well when I want to create very basic
      web pages.

  "css":          [
    `
      I use CSS for styling small websites. I have used it plenty, and thus I can get pages to look 
      mostly desirable with just what I have memorized. I still use vanilla CSS for small web projects,
      but, in practice, I prefer either SASS or Tailwind CSS.

  "java":         [
    `
      I used Java when learning about the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm. These days I 
      primarily use it for back-end development. 
    `

  "python":       [
    `
      The very first programming language I have used. It was my main language for early projects.
      On top of that, I used it to finish my first project I have taken seriously: FollowTracker.
      I am confident with my skills with Python and have seen its value in things like web-scraping,
      basic application creation and general-purpose programming.

      In terms of work, I have created both client and server scripts for a university course. The 
      students used the client script I had written in order to access the server in a Raspberry Pi.
      The intention was making Wireshark captures.
