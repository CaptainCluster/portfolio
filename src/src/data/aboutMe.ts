        I am a third-year bachelor's degree software engineering student in LUT University. My studies 
        serve as an opportunity for me to learn and, most importantly, as guidance for pursuing 
        knowledge independently. The curriculum has to touch upon so many things that many essential 
        software engineering skills are touched upon in few courses. Not only that, there may be 
        high pauses in such courses, if they are completed in the suggested order. By pursuing
        knowledge independently, I can focus on areas I consider essential in software engineering
        without being too dependent on what the university teaches me. I still value the courses and 
        learn a lot from them, but I believe that what makes great software engineers is enthusiasm
        goes beyond.

        Not only have studies provided me with guidance and tools for figuring out what to learn, the 
        college setting has given me an optimal environment for networking and practising social 
        skills.

        I have been programming for approximately 2.5 years. During this time I have gained a lot of
        knowledge and experience essential for programming. The area of expertise I have pursued the 
        most is full-stack web development. React (TypeScript) is my go-to front-end library. For 
        back-end I use either Spring Boot (Java) or Express (TypeScript). I prefer PostgreSQL for 
        database management.

        I am willing to give my dedication to projects and causes I value. For instance, I am
        maintaining the websites of two of my university guilds. The guilds are the following: Cluster
        Ry (software engineering guild) and ESN Lappeenranta (exchange student guild). Not only that, 
        I am currently working on a large software project as a volunteer front-end developer. The 
        project is being worked on by a group of students.

      `
        I enjoy teaching other people how to improve their software engineering skills. I have five 
        months of experience as a teaching assistant, and during this time I have worked hard to 
        help students learn various theoretical and practical things. On top of that, I enjoy both 
        helping people I like with their projects and giving them opportunities to create connections
        for collaborative software development.
