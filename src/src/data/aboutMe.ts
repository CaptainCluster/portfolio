        I am a third-year Bachelor's Degree Software Engineering student in LUT University. I have 
        been developing software solutions for approximately 2.5 years. The projects I have worked 
        on during this time reflect my passion towards software engineering in its various forms:
        art, industry, "lifestyle", etc. Putting my skills to good use provides me with a lot of
        satisfaction. I have months of work experience in helping people learn essential software 
        engineering skills. Not only that, I have been building and maintaining websites to help 
        organizations and university guilds in their activities, as I value their cause.

        My studies serve as an opportunity for me to learn and, most importantly, as guidance for 
        pursuing knowledge independently. The curriculum has to touch upon so many things that many 
        essential software engineering skills are touched upon in few courses. Not only that, there 
        may be high pauses in such courses, if they are completed in the suggested order. By pursuing
        knowledge independently, I can focus on areas I consider essential in software engineering
        without being too dependent on what the university teaches me. I still value the courses and 
        learn a lot from them, but I believe that what makes great software engineers is enthusiasm
        goes beyond.

        Not only have studies provided me with guidance and tools for figuring out what to learn, the 
        college setting has given me an optimal environment for networking and practising social 
        skills.

        I have been programming for approximately 2.5 years. During this time I have gained a lot of
        knowledge and experience essential for programming. The area of expertise I have pursued the 
        most is full-stack web development. React (TypeScript) is my go-to front-end library. For 
        back-end I use either Spring Boot (Java) or Express (TypeScript). I prefer PostgreSQL for 
        database management.

        I am willing to give my dedication to projects and causes I value. For instance, I am
        maintaining the websites of two of my university guilds. The guilds are the following: Cluster
        Ry (software engineering guild) and ESN Lappeenranta (exchange student guild). Not only that, 
        I am currently working on a large software project as a volunteer front-end developer. The 
        project is being worked on by a group of students.

        I enjoy teaching other people how to improve their software engineering skills. I have five 
        months of experience as a teaching assistant, and during this time I have worked hard to 
        help students learn various theoretical and practical things. On top of that, I enjoy both 
        helping people I like with their projects and giving them opportunities to create connections
        for collaborative software development.

        I enjoy thinking and assessing complex things about how life works. Through consistent and 
        open-minded thinking I have managed to plan approaches and make decisions that have 
        significantly improved my life in various ways: sustainability, independence, happiness,
        fulfillment, etc. I value critical thinking, transparency and civil debating. Through this 
        viewpoints are put to test and strengthened. Not only that, new ideas can be adopted.

        I used to be very invested in video gaming. These days I do it quite little, but love 
        discussing about them and appreciate them (especially as a form of art). These days I
        mostly spend my free time in student events and casual social interactions. I also program
        a lot when I have time. Not only that, I also enjoy learning languages (French, Chinese)
        and playing my electric guitar.
