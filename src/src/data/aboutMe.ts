        I am a third-year bachelor's degree software engineering student in LUT University. My studies 
        serve as an opportunity for me to learn and, most importantly, as guidance for pursuing 
        knowledge independently. The curriculum has to touch upon so many things that many essential 
        software engineering skills are touched upon in few courses. Not only that, there may be 
        high pauses in such courses, if they are completed in the suggested order. By pursuing
        knowledge independently, I can focus on areas I consider essential in software engineering
        without being too dependent on what the university teaches me. I still value the courses and 
        learn a lot from them, but I believe that what makes great software engineers is enthusiasm
        goes beyond.

        Not only have studies provided me with guidance and tools for figuring out what to learn, the 
        college setting has given me an optimal environment for networking and practising social 
        skills.
